# AutocorrelationCPP

A command line tool with visualization autocorrelation calculation (from cryptography). There is still some way to go to make this a more effective tool (a lot of performance issues right now) and there is currently a bug for multiline text's, ie. only the first line gets shifted for autocorrelation calculation.

I plan on extending this over time, especially to do cryptographic analysis on non-latin alphabets. Might even do an app with a proper GUI and diagramming features. We'll see.
